== Description
`less` is a tool to view large files on the CLI. It does not have to read the entire input of a file like common text editors. So even logfiles with the size of a GB can be inspected with it.
The commands are based on the tools `more` and http://kacperbak.github.io/VI-effective-usage.html[vi].
