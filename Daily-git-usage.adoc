== Working with a local test repository
* We assume that we are in an empty folder
* Create a local repository with the name `testrepo`.

....
git init --bare testrepo
....
* Type `ls -al` to get an overview.
* As you can see the last command created a directory with the name `testrepo`.
* To clone that repo we need the exact file system path. So type `pwd` to get your current location.
* Now you can `clone` the repo with the following command.

....
git clone file:///Users/bakka/Projects/gitRepos/testrepo
....

* As you can see, the `testrepo` name has been added to the end of the absolut path.
* The command is using the `file` protocoll as we operate on our local machine.
