== Setting up a Git on the CLI
There are a few convenience settings to use Git very smoothly from your command line interface like bash.
Simple follow the links to achieve the wanted result:

* https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/[Setting your username in Git]
* http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks[Auto completion of the current branch name with the `tabulator` key]
* https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases[Define short aliases `st` for standard commands like `status`]
* https://coderwall.com/p/fz0e0g/show-current-git-branch-name-in-bash-ps1[Shows the current branch in the bash prompt]

== Number of commits per user
....
git shortlog -sne
....

== Working with a local test repository
* We assume that we are in an empty folder
* Create a local repository with the name `testrepo`.

....
git init --bare testrepo
....
* Type `ls -al` to get an overview.
* As you can see the last command created a directory with the name `testrepo`.
* To clone that repo we need the exact file system path. So type `pwd` to get your current location.
* Now you can `clone` the repo with the following command.

....
git clone file:///Users/bakka/Projects/gitRepos/testrepo
....

* As you can see, the `testrepo` name has been added to the end of the absolut path.
* The command is using the `file` protocoll as we operate on our local machine.
