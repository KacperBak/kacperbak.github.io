== BetterSnapTool and Spectacle - Window managers in OS X
.Problem
It is uncomfortable to resize windows with OS X in the most common needed positions like: halfscreen-**left**, -**right**, -**up**, -**down** or **expanded to fullscreen** at all.
And the given default options of full-screen mode and maximize are not sufficient if you are used to work with a lot of application windows.
Especially that a lot of actions in OS X are based on drag and drop, so that resizing and positioning windows is a vital performance aspect.

.Solutions
I'm not a big fan of microsoft products anymore, but in this case Windows 7 has introduced a very handy solution.
It supports automatic resize for the most used window positions, just with the +window+ + +arrow+ keys. This approach is adopted by apps like **BetterSnapTool** and **Spectacle**.

https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12&uo=4[**BetterSnapTool**]
is very simple to use, by custumizable keyboard shortcuts or simple drag and drop of app windows.
To avoid collisions with other tools on my system, I use the +ctrl+ + +alt+ + +...+ mapping.
While +...+ is mapped to a keyboard +key+ for an action or a window position.

I also enjoy the multi monitor support, that allows to move a app window to the next connected monitor.
BetterSnapTool is a commercial tool but moderately priced. With the expense of two bucks you get a higly reliable and customizable solution.

http://spectacleapp.com[**Spectacle**] is the right app if you looking for an open source solution for **keyboard** usage **only**.

== Alfred - Quick application launcher

.Problem
As a power user I want to have a very quick access to all my installed applications on my machine. Mac OS has already a very powerful tool that can be used for this purpose: _Spotlight_.
But the results of _spotlight_ contain ALL types of indexed files and are not focused on applications.

.Solution
*Alfred* focuses on applications on your mac and displays mostly a set of apps as a result.

* Free in _basic_ version.
* Keyboard shortcut based: +alt+ + +space+.
* Gets focus from _maximized_ and _minimized_ windows.
* Reminds most used version of an app, in case of different versions are installed.

== TextExpander - Fast snippets for your entire mac
.Problem
Typing long phrases by hand takes time and is also error-prone.

.Solution
*TextExpander* brings managed snippets to your entire mac.
For each common used word or paragraph, you can define a short phrase that is typed instead of the long term.
Those phrases can also be parametrized so that only new content, like the current date or a bug number, has to be filled in.


* Start with a simple match like your signature: Type +;kb+  to get _Kacper Bak_ completed.
* Create entire text phrases, where only _new_ content has to be entered.
* Demo version works without a license.
