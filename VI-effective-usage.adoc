== Basics
VI has two basic modes:

.Command mode
All actions around VI are taken from _command mode_.
To enter _command mode_ hit +ESC+ key. As response the status bar indicates an empty state. To execute a command it should be initilized by a colon +:+ followed by the command +q+ (in this case _quit_) and finished by hitting the enter/return key +CR+.

E.g. +:q+ +Enter+

.Insert mode
In this mode all key strokes are inserted into the document, like in common GUI editors.
To get from _command mode_ to _insert mode_ the user has to hit +i+.
The status bar indicates this state with _-- INSERT --_.

== Switch to command mode
ESC

== Movement
Most of the movement in the document is being done from _command mode_. In _insert mode_ the user can navigate via the +arrow keys+.
