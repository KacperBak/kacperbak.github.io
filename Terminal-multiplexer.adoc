= Terminal multiplexer

Working on two platforms (Linux/OSX) at once, is sometime cumbersome.
Especially when it comes to memorize keyboard bindings for the same kind of software like a terminal.
It is a lot easier to create a common set of key bindings between two platforms, then to mentally switch between those two.
This `common set` is being referenced as `custom binding` in the next sections.
