To debug the https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-tomcat-plugin[gradle-tomcat-plugin] in Intellij IDEA there are two run/debug configurations required.
It has not worked out for me to establish an debug connection as the server has been run from the CLI. Despite of the fact the `GRADLE_OPTS` has been set correctly.
Both configurations has to be run from the IDE itself!

The entire example is available on https://github.com/KacperBak/spring-mvc/tree/debug-with-gradle-tomcat-plugin[GitHub]
It has been tested with Gradle 2.11 and JDK 1.8.0_65 on OSX with IDEA 15.0.2.

== Problem: Debugging fails
If your `GRADLE_OPTS` are set correctly and you run an gradle task like `tomcatRunWar` to run the container, you get the following outcome.
....
$ gradle tomcatRunWar
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5005
To honour the JVM settings for this build a new JVM will be forked. Please consider using the daemon: https://docs.gradle.org/2.11/userguide/gradle_daemon.html.
:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes UP-TO-DATE
:war UP-TO-DATE
:tomcatRunWar
Started Tomcat Server
The Server is running at http://localhost:8080/spring-mvc
> Building 80% > :tomcatRunWar
....
That seems ok, because the server started and the JVM is listening on port 5005 to connect.

== Remote debug configuration
Now it's time to connect to the running server process with your InteliJ IDEA by adding an `Remote` configuration and setting it to the address 5005.
That should look like this:

After start the debug config by hitting the debug button and your IDE responds with:
....
Connected to the target VM, address: 'localhost:5005', transport: 'socket'
....

But something seems not to be working. For example if you set an break point into an controller and trigger the GET request the debugger is NOT *stopping*!
It seems the the connection between the debugger and the running java process is not established.

== Solution: Run embedded tomcat config in your IDE
Start your embedded tomcat also from IntelliJ IDEA by a run/debug config.
To do so, create a simple Gradle config with your task like `tomcatRunWar` and set the JVM options direct in the config.

After that, simply startup both configurations respectively in your IDE.

* Start your embedded-tomcat with `Run embedded tomcat config` by hitting run-button.
* Connect to it with your `debug config` by hitting debug-button.
